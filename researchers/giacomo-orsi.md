# Giacomo Orsi
Giacomo is a Research Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the Senseable City Lab and at AMS Institute.

He earned a master’s degree in computer science from EPFL in Switzerland and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Bologna in Italy.

His research focuses on applying large-scale data analysis, causality, and machine learning to urban dynamics, with a strong commitment to open data, open knowledge, and sustainable mobility.

At MIT Senseable City Lab and AMS Institute, Giacomo specializes in big-data analysis and the application of artificial intelligence in the mobility sector. He is currently exploring the effects of lowering city-wide speed limits from 50 km/h to 30 km/h, utilizing computer vision techniques to identify street features that encourage compliance with the new limits.

>“Open data isn't just about transparency; it's key for accountability, it's a gateway for research, and the spark for innovation in public services. They can guide us toward a more informed and empowered society, where knowledge is a shared asset”
